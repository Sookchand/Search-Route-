# Search Route Planning
This is a solution to the Route Problem using the SimpleAI library. The Route Problem is a search problem in which the goal is to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. The SimpleAI library provides various search algorithms for solving this problem, including breadth-first search, depth-first search, and uniform-cost search.

## Demo

Breadth-First Search (FIFO):
- The route is [1, 6, 5], and total cost is 23.
Depth-First Search (LIFO):
- The route is [1, 6, 5], and total cost is 23.
Uniform-Cost Search:
- The route is [1, 3, 6, 5], and total cost is 20.
